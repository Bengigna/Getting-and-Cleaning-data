Data Tidying

The provided datasets were transformed into a data frame (contained in "Output_Data" ) and stored in the run_analysis.R project. 
This new dataset is a principal research dataset of interest. The data frame was transformed from by following these steps:

1. Combine the datasets of train and test into one, and subset the features with only mean or std in feature name.
2. Add subject_Id (1-30) and activities (by name) into a single data frame

Data cleaning

A data frame with 81 columns were resulted. The Subject_ID is the subject ID which is in the range of 1:30, and 
Activity refers to the activity performed by the subject

Final Result

The result, named as output_data, were written to a text file with a name of "mean_result.txt". 
The result contiains every unique combined subject ID and activity with mean of each measures of interest for that specific group
